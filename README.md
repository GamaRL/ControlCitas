## üéØ Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Allow users (patients, doctors, receptionists) to efficiently manage medical appointments.
- Facilitate booking, confirmation, and cancellation of appointments through a web portal.
- Generate reports in Excel format for better appointment control.
- Ensure user verification and protect sensitive data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
The system was developed using the following technologies:
- **Backend**: PHP (Laravel Framework)
- **Frontend**: Blade (Laravel), HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: Eloquent for data management
- **Data Export**: Laravel Excel for generating reports in spreadsheets
- **IDE**: PhpStorm
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, which ensures a clear separation between business logic, data management, and user interface.

### General Structure
- **Model**: Defines the structure of the stored data (Users, Appointments, Doctors, etc.).
- **View**: Blade templates for presenting information to users.
- **Controller**: Manages business logic, coordinating views and models.

## üöÄ Key Features

### System Users
1. **Patients**
   - Register and log in to the system.
   - View available schedules and book appointments.
   - Confirm or cancel appointments.
   - View appointment history and receive email notifications.

2. **Doctors**
   - Manage their profile and consultation schedules.
   - Attend to appointments, add notes and treatments.
   - Review patient history and generate reports.

3. **Receptionists**
   - Manage appointments for all doctors.
   - Confirm patient attendance via email notifications.
   - Export appointment reports in Excel format.

### Highlighted Use Cases
- **Registration and Authentication**: Users can register as patients or doctors and verify their email.
- **Appointment Management**: View and edit schedules, confirm and cancel appointments.
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic appointment reminders.
- **Reports**: Generate monthly reports in Excel for easier management.
